# TediFramework
### Simple framework for PHP with routing and views

## Framework structure
 1. `tedi-config`
This directory contains **configuration files** for the TediFramework.
 2. `tedi-logic`
This folder holds all the **core logic files**. It includes controllers, services, and business logic that define how the application processes data and interacts with the database. This is where the core functionality and algorithms are implemented.
 5. `tedi-routing`
This path manages **routing definitions** for the application. It contains files that map URLs to specific controllers or handlers, defining how requests are processed and which functions are executed for each route.
 6. `tedi-views`
This directory contains **view templates** for the frontend. It includes HTML files that are **intermixed with PHP code**, enabling dynamic content rendering. The views define how data should be presented to users, often using placeholders for data populated by the application logic.
